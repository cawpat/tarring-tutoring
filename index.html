                        My name is Vanessa Gibbons and I have been teaching English since 1995 at secondary schools and sixth-form colleges around Sussex.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        I have extensive experience of teaching Key Stage 3/GCSE English and A-level Literature.  I have also taught young people with special needs and worked briefly in primary school. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have a Master's degree in English Literature and a teaching qualification for ages 11 - 18.   I also have recent qualifications in teenage mental health and autism.
