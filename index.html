                    <p>
                        My name is Vanessa Gibbons and I have been teaching English since 1995 at secondary schools and sixth-form colleges around Sussex.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        I have extensive experience of teaching Key Stage 3/GCSE English and A-level Literature. I have also taught young people with special needs and worked briefly in primary school. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have a Master's degree in English Literature and a teaching qualification for ages 11 - 18. I am an accredited tutor with the National Tutoring programme. I also have recent qualifications in autism and teenage mental health. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have updated DBS clearance and safeguarding training.
